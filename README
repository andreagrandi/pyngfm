Posting a message to Ping.fm
============================

Syncronous Client
-----------------

    from pyngfm.client import PingFMSyncClient
    from pyngfm.exception import PingFMResponseError

    # both keys are needed to use this library
    api_key = "xxx"
    user_app_key = "yyy"
    pinger = PingFMSyncClient(api_key, user_app_key)
    try:
        pinger.user_post('status','testing Ping.FM Python API :)')
        print pinger.reponse.status
    except PingFMResponseError, e:
        print pinger.reponse.status
        print e


Asyncronous Client
------------------

Just to keep things fresh, this example exercises a different method:

    from twisted.internet import reactor
    from pyngfm.client import PingFMAsyncClient
    from pyngfm.exception import PingFMResponseError

    def check_result(messages):
        for message in messages:
            print "title:", message.title
            print "body:", message.body
            services = [s.id for s in message.services]
            print "services:", services, "\n"

    def check_error(error):
        print error.getErrorMessage()

    def finish(ignored):
        reactor.stop()

    api_key = "xxx"
    user_app_key = "yyy"

    pinger = PingFMAsyncClient(api_key, user_app_key)
    deferred = pinger.user_latest()
    deferred.addCallback(check_result)
    deferred.addErrback(check_error)
    deferred.addCallback(finish)

    reactor.run()


Testing the Source Code
=======================

With the inclusion of Twisted support, unit tests started getting added. Since
the Twisted test runner (trial) is easy to use with nicely legible output, the
unit tests are written for use with trial.

To run the unit tests, simply make sure you are in the top-level source
directory of pyngfm, and execute the following:

    $ trial pyngfm

You can also run unit tests by subpackage:

    $ trial pyngfm/client/

Or module:

    $ trial pyngfm/client/tests/test_async.py

Or even using Python namespace dotted notation:

    $ trial pyngfm.client.tests.test_async

Note that this allows running the unit tests at a finer-grained level:

    $ trial pyngfm.client.tests.test_base.BaseClientTestCase.test_build_url
